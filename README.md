=============
Software Engineering Project

#Instructions on how to run the website:

1) Download GitHub and the Git Shell

2) Run the Git Shell on any command prompt

3) Go to desired directory with cd command

4) Type in "git clone https://github.com/aethius/VirtualBioLab.git"

5) Type in "cd demo"

6) Type in "npm install"

Because of default design, "local.js" was not saved onto github. 
Thus, it is necessary to create a new one.

7) Create new file in /demo/config/ in notepad

8) Copy and paste the README file in the demo folder onto the new file

9) Save as "local.js"

10) Go back to the Git Shell and type in "sails lift"
