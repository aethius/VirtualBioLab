----------------------------
---------FOR Python---------
----------------------------

Necessary Technologies
 (Python)  
----------------------
---------  
Python 2.7 and the Pygame module must be installed in order to 
run the program. More info can be found here:
 
https://www.python.org/
  
http://www.pygame.org/news.html


Installation
  (Python)
------------
----------  
Python and Pygame should both be installed. The folder containing
 the source code and the graphic images should be downloaded:

https://www.dropbox.com/sh/xfug43jcfjxzvvc/g1oL9tV5o2

After the files have been downloaded, make sure they are in the
same directory/folder. Then, the BioLabSim.py file must be run
 
in a Python environment. A window will then pop up, and the simulation
will then run.
  
  

---------------------------
---------FOR MySQL---------
---------------------------

Installation (MySQL) 
-------------------- 
Both Microsoft SQL Server and Adventureworks Database should be downloaded, 
but only SQL needs to be installed. Run SQL Server Management Studio, 
right click on database, choose attach. Choose 'add' in the attach window 
and find file: "AdventureWorksDW2012_Data.mdf" from our provided files. 
If you feel more comfortable, you may attach the downloaded .mdf from 
the website and go to: 
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL11.MSSQLSERVER\MSSQL\AdventureWorksDW2012 
and replace the data.mdf and the log.mdf file with the ones provided. 
From here you can run the queries, also provided, to edit, add, update 
the tables as you see fit.

Necessary Technologies (MySQL)
---------------------------- 
Microsoft SQL Server 2012 Express (Version used: Win7x64 SP1. Would suggest

------------------------------------
---------FOR JavaScript/CSS---------
------------------------------------

Installation (JavaScript/CSS)
-----------------------------
All the previously mentioned technologies must be installed. Open the git shell 
on any command prompt. Go to the desired directory for the location of the files. 
Type in “git clone https://github.com/aethius/VirtualBioLab.git”. Type in 
“cd VirtualBioLab/demo”. Type in “npm  install”. Make sure bcrypt is installed. 
Sometimes it doesn’t (by fault of the module) and has to be manually installed 
and placed in necessary location. It should be placed in 
“VirtualBioLab/demo/node_modules”. With bcrypt accurately installed, type in 
“sails lift”. It is then necessary to type in “http://localhost:1337” into any 
browser to see the website. 

Necessary Technologies (JavaScript/CSS)
---------------------------------------
Git must be installed.

-------------FOR HTML---------------
------------------------------------

Installation (HTML)
-------------------
Since there is no technology needed to run the HTML pages, no new programs need 
to be installed.

Necessary Technologies (HTML)
-----------------------------
There is nothing needed to install to run the HTML pages. Any source code text 
holder will do for constructing the independent HTML pages.
